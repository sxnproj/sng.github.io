Hello, and welcome to my website. This is a project I wanted to undertake as having my own personal website seemed to be a cool thing to have as well as a way to learn about making and deploying a website, something that has intrigued me for awhile. My interest in computers has taken me around software and hardware spaces with particular interest in RTL design and verification for FPGAs and ASICS.

Currently I am conducting research and finishing my Masters thesis which you can read about in my projects.

I will use this website to document many of my personal projects as well as other projects I am interested with. You can find my projects in the projects tab on the top bar.
